initialize the robot 
set the threshold for the orientation a_th
set linear distance threshold for grab silver token d_th
set linear distance threshold for release gold token d_th_gold
set an empty list where it will put the silver token once it grab it silver
set an empty list where put the golden token once it release the silver token near to it gold

function to go forward

function to turn 

def find_silver_token():
function to find the closest silver token 
	set an empty list
	for evry token seen
		if the token is silver and it isn't already taken
			add to the list of silver token distance, orientation and code of the silver token
	if silver is empty 
		return -1, -1 , -1
	else 
		sort the list of silver token by increasing distances
		set dist to 100 
		if the distance of the first element of the list of silver token is less then dist
			set dist to distance of first element in the list of silver token
			set orienation to the orienation to the first silver token 
			set code to the code of the first silver token
		if dist is 100 
			return -1, -1,-1
		else 
			return dist, orientation, code

def find_gold_token():
function to find gold is the same of find_silver_token changing silver with gold so the only important changes are in the first if by checking if the silver token is gold and the code isn't in the list of already taken gold token 

def go_gold():
function to go the closest gold token and once it is there release the silver token it grabbed before
	while haven't go to every gold token (list of gold token has less the 6 elements):
		find_gold_token()
		if it doesn't see any token:
			turn
		elif the distance is less than the linear distance threshold for gold
			release the token you grabbed 
			add the id of the token to the list of taken gold token
			return
		elif robot is aligned with the token
			go forward
		elif robot not aligned with the token, token on the left
			turn left
		elif robot not aligned with the token, token on the right
			turn right
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
		
	

while you haven't grab every token
	find the closest silver
	go to the closest silver token
	if your distance less then threshold
		release silver token
		turn around 
		find the closest gold
		go to the golden token 
		if you are close to the golden token
			release golden token		
			


		return dist, orientation, code


function to find gold is the same will change only the first if by checking if the silver token is gold and the code isn't in the list of already taken gold token
