set the threshold for the orientation
set threshold for distance
set distance threshold for gold token

set an empty list where put silver token
set an empty list where put gold token

while you haven't grab every token
	find the closest silver
	go to the closest silver token
	if your distance less then threshold
		release silver token
		turn around 
		find the closest gold
		go to the golden token 
		if you are close to the golden token
			release golden token		
			

function to find the closest silver token 
set an empty list
for evry token seen
	if the token is silver and it isn't already taken
		add to the list of silver token distance, orientation and code of the silver token
if silver is empty 
	return -1, -1 , -1
else 
	sort the list of silver token by increasing distances
	set dist to 100 
	if the distance of the first element of the list of silver token is less then dist
		set dist to distance of first element in the list of silver token
		set orienation to the orienation to the first silver token 
		set code to the code of the first silver token
	if dist is 100 
		return -1, -1,-1
	else 
		return dist, orientation, code


function to find gold is the same will change only the first if by checking if the silver token is gold and the code isn't in the list of already taken gold token
