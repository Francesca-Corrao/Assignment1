Research Track 1- Assignment 1
================================

This the repository for the solution of the First Assignemnt for the course Research Trask 1.

The goal of the assignment is to develop a robot that make pairs of silver and gold marker on the map by taking a silver marker and bring it to a gold one.
To do this we will use a python robot simulator developed by [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org) with arenas modified for the class.

How to Run the solution
----------------------
In order to run the solution inside the robot-sim folder you have to execute 
```
python2 run.py assignment.py
```
it's important to specify to use python 2 because otherwise it won't execute if try to execute with python 3

How it works 
---------
#describe the code triplo apice mostra i blocchi grigi

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

PseudoCode
----------
```
int i = 
```

Improvement
-----------
